# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Verily"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then Doxygen will create up to 4096
# sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format
# and will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding Doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise cause

# control the number of sub-directories.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# Controls the number of sub-directories that will be created when
# CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES. Level 0 represents 16 directories, and every
# level increment doubles the number of directories, resulting in 4096

# sub-directories are organized in 2 levels, the first level always has a fixed

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT tag is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or

# The size of the symbol lookup cache can be set using LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE. This

# code, Doxygen keeps a cache of pre-resolved symbols. If the cache is too small
# Doxygen will become slower. If the cache is too large, memory is wasted. The
# cache size is given by this formula: 2^(16+LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range
# is 0..9, the default is 0, corresponding to a cache size of 2^16=65536
# symbols. At the end of a run Doxygen will report the cache usage and suggest

# speed. At this moment only the input processing can be done using multiple
# threads. Since this is still an experimental feature the default is set to 1,
